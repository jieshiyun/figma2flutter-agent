# figma2flutter-agent

Convert a Figma mobile screen into maintainable Flutter UI code.

`figma2flutter-agent` is a small, deterministic pipeline: it reads a Figma node
(a local JSON file or a live node URL), lowers it to a compact Design IR, plans
reusable components, and emits readable Dart. Optional layers validate the
output with `flutter analyze`, diff the render against Figma for fidelity, and
repair regressions.

> Scope: Flutter only, mobile portrait, static layout. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)
> for the full spec and the step-by-step development log.

## Pipeline

```
Figma JSON ─► Design IR ─► Component Plan ─► Flutter code ─► validate ─► repair
```

- **`ir_parser`** — Figma node tree → Design IR (frames, text, rectangles,
  images, ellipses, components, icons, lines; auto-layout → flow, otherwise
  absolute Stack positioning).
- **`planner`** — IR → Component Plan: each named frame is lifted into its own
  `StatelessWidget` and structurally-identical instances are deduped, so codegen
  emits small, reusable widgets instead of one giant `build`.
- **`codegen`** — Plan → Dart. Interns repeated style literals into
  `AppColors` / `AppSpacing` / `AppTextStyles` design tokens (semantic color
  names when the Figma file publishes Styles).
- **`validator` / `repair`** — run `flutter analyze`; on failure, optionally ask
  an LLM to patch the file and re-check.

## Quickstart

Run from source — the only runtime dependencies are Pillow and numpy:

```bash
pip install pillow numpy pytest
pytest                    # 244 tests, no network or Flutter required

# Generate a screen from the bundled sample:
python -m agent.cli \
  --input examples/figma_sample.json \
  --output flutter_app/lib/generated_screen.dart
```

The generated file passes `flutter analyze` cleanly inside `flutter_app/`.

Optionally install as a package (needs a modern pip/setuptools) to get the
`figma2flutter` command:

```bash
pip install -e .
figma2flutter --input examples/figma_sample.json --output flutter_app/lib/generated_screen.dart
```

## CLI

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--input PATH` | Local Figma node JSON (or a saved `/nodes` response). |
| `--figma-url URL` | Fetch a node live via the Figma REST API (needs a token). |
| `--figma-token TOKEN` | Figma token (defaults to `$FIGMA_TOKEN`). |
| `--output PATH` | Where to write the generated Dart. |
| `--validate` | Run `flutter analyze` after generation. |
| `--repair` | On analyze failure, ask the LLM to fix the file and re-check. |
| `--visual-validate` | Screenshot the screen and diff it against the Figma render (prints a 0–100 score). |
| `--geometry-validate` | Diff each node's rendered rect against Figma's layout (per-node position/size deviations). |
| `--repair-geometry` | Iteratively nudge node positions/sizes toward the Figma layout. |
| `--save-run` | Archive inputs, plan, output, and reports under `runs/`. |
| `--llm` | *(experimental)* Use the LLM planner — see limitations below. |

Run `python -m agent.cli --help` for the full set (tolerances, attempt counts,
reference images, scale factors).

### Live Figma + LLM (optional)

```bash
export FIGMA_TOKEN=...                 # Figma personal access token
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...            # enables --repair / --llm (DeepSeek)
# optional: DEEPSEEK_MODEL (default deepseek-v4-flash), DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL

python -m agent.cli --figma-url "https://www.figma.com/design/<key>/...?node-id=..." \
  --output flutter_app/lib/screen.dart --repair --visual-validate
```

Without `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` the pipeline stays fully deterministic; the LLM path
is never exercised in tests (a fake client is injected).

## What's supported

- **Nodes:** frame, text, rectangle, image, ellipse, INSTANCE/GROUP/COMPONENT,
  rounded-rect vectors, icon vectors (rasterized via the Figma image API on a
  live source), and axis-aligned LINE dividers.
- **Layout:** vertical/horizontal auto-layout (`Column`/`Row` with spacing,
  padding, alignment, `spaceBetween`), per-child counter-axis fill
  (`layoutAlign`), and absolute Stack positioning for non-auto-layout frames.
- **Style:** solid fills, borders, corner radius, image fills, real bundled
  fonts (Inter), Figma line-height, and deduped design tokens.

## Limitations

- **LLM planner (`--llm`) is experimental.** It adds no layout-quality gain over
  the deterministic planner today and can truncate on large pages. The supported
  LLM capability is `--repair` (fixing `flutter analyze` errors). DeepSeek v4 is
  text-only, so it does not consume the visual/geometry diffs.
- **Diagonal vectors** (arbitrary path geometry) are skipped — only axis-aligned
  lines and rounded-rect vectors are reproduced.
- **Icon rasterization** needs a live `--figma-url` (file key + token); a
  saved-file run emits same-size placeholders so layout stays correct.
- Single mobile-portrait viewport; no interactions, state, or responsive
  breakpoints.
